1. The purpose of this assignment is to create a java program that takes as input, via the command line, a file specifying an Adjacency List for a graph.
   This Graph has to be recreated in the java program by creating a class named AdjacencyList<Edge> and storing the details of the graph provided in the File in an object of class 
   type AdjacencyList<Edge>. Where Edge is another class that stores a "destination vertex" and a "weight".

   EXAMPLE FILE (example.txt) is provided with this README.txt 

   Note: Graphs considered for this project are directed graphs. [extra marks for creating a function to incorporate addition of undirected edges]

2. when the program is executed, the java program should 
	a: read the given file
	b: create the AdjacencyList
	c: ask the user for to input a Vertex name (in our example.txt: either A,B, etc). 
           Once the user enters the Vertex name, the program should return all edges(name and weight) that is associated with the entered vertex.
	   
           For example:
		Enter a Vertex Name: A
		B 20, C 35, D 15
